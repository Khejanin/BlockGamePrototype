## B_Logic

### Overview
- Player controls a cube in a 3D environment, which moves on a 3D grid by rotating it in the chosen direction.
- Player cube can attach to other cuboids on the grid.
- Attached cuboids move with the player → the shape of the player changes to form a cuboid → the axis around which the cube rotates around to move changes.
- Player can release attached cuboids at any time, this allows the player to reach higher places on the grid, overcome gaps, open up or block passages.
- Essentially, it allows the player to rearrange the whole level
- The goal is to reach a certain tile in the 3D grid with the player cube (not with the attached cuboids)
